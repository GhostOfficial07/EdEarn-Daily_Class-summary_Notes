    <!----- Today we learned about basics of Programming and Javascript ----->
    
    <!-- In basics of programming we learned:

                                                                                  > High Level Language

                                              > let() :- It is changable. Means, we can change its value like., a = 10; a = 15;
                                              > const() :- It is unchangable. Means, we can't change its value like., a = 10; a = 15; ( it will show error or it will not accept 
                                                            a = 15 because it's already assigned with the value 10)  -->
